Program that visualizes fractals. You can zoom in by pressing the left mouse button or zoom out by pressing the right mouse button.
Some nice-looking Julia set fractals can be visualized with the complex numbers: (0, i0.8), (0.37, i0.1), (0.355, i0.355),
(-0.54, i0.54), (-0.4, i-0.59), (-0.54, i0.54), (0.355534, -i0.337292).

The program would run a lot faster if it were running on the GPU, but for this implementation, it is running on the CPU.
